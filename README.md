# House_Price_Prediction
The House Price Prediction System is an innovative web-based application developed using the Shiny framework in R to provide accurate and real-time predictions of property prices. The system is designed to assist homebuyers, real estate agents, and developers by estimating house prices based on specific user inputs, including area type, location, BHK, square footage, bathrooms, and balconies. By leveraging data-driven methodologies and a user-friendly interface, the application addresses the challenges of existing systems, such as lack of personalization, time delays, and inconsistent valuations.<br>
The core dataset used includes critical real estate features like area type, location, size, and amenities, ensuring the model captures the most influential factors for pricing. Data preprocessing techniques like handling missing values and encoding categorical data enhance the predictive model's accuracy. A linear regression model is trained with weighted inputs to deliver precise price estimates, ensuring reliable predictions for varied user scenarios.<br>
The Shiny application provides an intuitive interface where users can input property details and instantly receive price predictions. Unlike existing systems that rely on static price ranges or subjective evaluations, this system offers dynamic, tailored estimations in real time. The integration of interactivity with advanced modeling demonstrates the power of R in bridging user needs with robust data analysis.
